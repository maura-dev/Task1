# EXTRA QUESTIONS

## View and Pure functions
View functions are functions that do not change any state values e.g getter functions while Pure functions are functions that do not read or write to state values.

## Payable and Non-payable functions
Paybale functions are functions that can receive ether while non-payable functions cannot receive ether.

## Constant and immutable data type
Constant data types can never be changed after compilation while immutable data types  can be set within the contructor.

## Read and write functions
Read fuctions like the name implies help to read from state and they are usually known as getter functions. They do not alter state variables hence do not require gas fee while write fuctions are setter functions that alter the contract state and hence require gas fee
